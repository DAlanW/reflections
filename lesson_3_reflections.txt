When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are uploading something from another computer, or when you (or someone else) is adding to a shared repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling manually gives me the control over when a repository's changes are being saved on my own computer.
Also, this keeps the personal Git log from being cluttered if someone else is also pushing commits to GitHub.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are used in Git to refer to repositories that all originated at an earlier commit, but which are being developed seperately from each other.
There is usualy a master branch, which is most likely to be shared publicly, and any number of "offshoots" which can be used to develop new ideas without interferring with the master branch.
A fork is a feature on GitHub that allows a developer to copy a repository onto their own profile where they can make changes, but won't be included on the original developer's profile.
The original repository will not reflect any changes the new developer might make on his/her own profile, but the "forked" repository works like a branch in that it still contains all of the commits from that original repository.
Cloning is simply copying a previously existing repository from one place to another, either from one place on the personal computer to another place, or from GitHub to the computer.
(A fork is specifically used on GitHub, though it is effectively like cloning on a PC)

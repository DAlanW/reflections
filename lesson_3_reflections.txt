When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are uploading something from another computer, or when you (or someone else) is adding to a shared repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling manually gives me the control over when a repository's changes are being saved on my own computer.
Also, this keeps the personal Git log from being cluttered if someone else is also pushing commits to GitHub.
